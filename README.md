    <p>Welcome to my project. This is a brief introduction to what it does and how to get started.</p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This project presents a novel stress detection machine learning model using image processing and a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs) specifically designed for IT professionals. The proposed model utilizes real-time facial expressions to detect stress, such as furrowed brows, tense jaw, and furrowed lips.  The proposed model has potential applications in the workplace for monitoring employee stress levels and providing interventions to improve workplace well-being and productivity. The proposed model is non-invasive and can be integrated with existing workplace technologies, making it an accessible and practical solution for stress detection in IT professionals.
